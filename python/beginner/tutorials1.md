# WELCOME #
This is the introduction of the python enviroment and we started the training with python3 which is the latest so far.
We are going to be doing everything we know on python 3. So gear up if you haven't lets start.

## First Program ##
The first program is to print the "Hello World!" on the screen.

```
It is assumed that you must have installed python 3 on your system;
but if you have not then follow these links to install on any of your OS:
```

- For all Operating Systems: [Python Website](https://python.org/downloads/)
- For windows watch this: [Install for Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DQsjE8vMpc)
- For MAC watch this: [Video on mac installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhv82tvFfkM)
- For Linux watch this: [Linux Installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAco2SSuGms)

*It's also your right to know that Linux and mac comes with some latest python distribution with it, so makes it quite easy to start running a python program.* 

~Back to Topic~


So writing your first program is just as simple as typing it.

```
>>> print('Hello, World!') -> [press enter]

Hello, World! -> [this is the result]
```
## Arithmetic Operators ##
After the first program lets checkout the arithmetic operators in python.

```
>>> 40 + 2 -> [press enter]
42 -> [result]

>>> 43 - 1 -> [press enter]
42 -> [result]

>>> 6 * 7 -> [press enter]
42 -> [result]

>>> 84 / 2 -> [press enter]
42.0 -> [result is not showing 42 rather it is showing 42.0 (it will be explained)]

>>> 6**2 + 6 -> [press enter]
42 -> [result as the operator raises a number to a power called 'Exponentiation']

>>> 6 ^ 2 -> [press enter]
4 -> [result and this is becos the ^ in python is for bitwise operations while in some other
languages it is used for Exponentiation]
```
## Values and Types ##
Values are the basic things programs work with, they are like letters, numbers and symbols.

In python3 the interpreter is designed to tell you the types of values you have
even if you dont know them.

lets look at this:
```
>>>type(2) -> [press enter]
<class 'int'> -> [result shows that the number 2 is an integer]

>>> type(42.0)
<class 'float'> -> [result shows that the number in the bracket is a float 'dont worry we wil explain)]

>>> type('Hello, World!') -> [press enter]
<class 'str'> -> [result shows that the whole thing within the bracket is a string]

## Formal and Natural Languages ##

**_Natural Languages:_** These are languages people speak, they were not designed by people they evolved naturally.

**_Formal Languages:_** These are languages designed for specific applications. Like chemist and mathematicians use. Programming languages are formal languages designed to express computation. They have syntax rules that govern them.

_Parsing:_ is the ability to figure out the structure of a language.

Formal and natural languages have many features in common and they are Tokens, Structure and Syntax but they have alot of differences too like:
*Ambiguity:*natural languages are full of ambiguity. Formal languages are designed to be less ambiguous and this means any statement has one meaning.
Other issues like redundancy, literalness and more are found in natural langs but are scarcely found in the formal languages. Formal languages are more dense than natural languages and so takes longer to read them. I would put it this way in conclusion that formal languages needs just simple steps to follow them in order to work with them effectively; and these steps are:

- Take time in reading formal languages
- Understand the structure as it is important.
- Parse the program in your head
- Identify the tokens and interprete the structure
- Finally lookout for details. Puntuations, small errors can keep you running up and down.
